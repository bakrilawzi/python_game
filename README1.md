## Rock Paper Scissors

# Instructions

Make a rock, paper, scissors game. 

Inside the `main.py` file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. This will make it easy to print them out to the console. 

Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

From there you will need to figure out: 
* How you will store the user's input.
* How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
* How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* And also how you will give feedback to the player.

## a bried cocnlusion about it and some tips :
this code helps you to improve your knowledge in python and especially in the (if and else loop) that are so important in your work in any programing languages
i highly recomend you to download (thonny) that's a cheat program for python(joking )  that can help you to understand how the computer execute your code if you feel alittle confuse about it , and i recomend to try to get your hand dirty in this code before you see my solution ,
go ahead and  start coding

## You can find the "official" rules of the game on [the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/)
